# Fancio
*Global Dev Challenge Hackathon*

## Problem 
   As someone who helps out with my family construction business, I notice many times that my father tends to have difficulty finding the right construction workers for a given contract. Many times due to the lack of time, he ends up having to drive around neighborhoods in order to pick up works who wait for contractors to offer them a temporary job.

   An analysis in the most recent Survey data by the National Association of Home Builders' Housing Economics shows that the percentage of *immigrant workers constitute nearly **25%** of the overall construction workforce*, however those workers tend to have difficulty obtaining jobs due to legal paperwork. On top of that, **70% of construction workers have a HS DIPLOMA**, with the second most common being with **NO education at 23%** *. This is a large issue as workers in todayâ€™s society, where high waged jobs reflect your level of education/professional network.


## Solution 
   This is why Fanci was developed. Fanci is a web app that **CONNECTS labor workers with contractors** looking for workers to help finish the job. This bridge between workers and contractors allows a *seamless and friendly bridge of connection* and provides both ends to have a *platform that is tailored for them* unlike other services websites (like Fiverr, Upwork, Craigslist) where the target audience is extremely broad and difficult to land a gig.

## Future Work
   - Work on signup screening process to verify user skills/credentials
   - Work on info/progress page for immigrant workers to track progress on legal paperwork
